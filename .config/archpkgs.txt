	texlive-most contains the useful packages (for me), so install this and then choose
	from the presented list.

	a custom udev rule needs to be made, and the user needs to be in the video group. 
	See the acpilight gitlab for instructions.

- kvantum 
	Theme engine for qt apps. 
	Set QT_THEME_OVERRIDE=kvantum in /etc/environment for this to work for all qt apps. 
	To install new themes, download (from KDE store - materia is a good one) and direct 
	kvantum to the downloaded folder. 

- xarchiver 
	Manages archives. Can be used with graphical file managers. 

- ntfs-3g
	NTFS file system driver (needed to mount NTFS volumes, like ext. hard drive)

# General Notes
####################################################

 -> Pacman can be configured with /etc/pacman.conf, of interest might be the ParallelDownloads, Color and ILoveCandy options.  

 -> Every now and again, run paccache command to clean cache, as it can grow quite large as packages are installed.

 -> The systemd journal can sometimes take long to flush on boots, especially if it gets large. Its total size can be limited with the --vacuum flags, and applied to active journals at the same time with --rotate.

 -> To blacklist kernel modules (useful for ex. with a broken internal wifi card, or bluetooth modules that are never used), create a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf file with 
	blacklist <module_name>
lines for each module. Will work after a reboot. 

 -> An aur helper like yay is useful for managing aur packages. Install yay manually using the instructions on the wiki, and then use the option --save --sudoloop for it to ask for the password before doing the download.  

 -> On the Acer laptop, even when SecureBoot is disabled it requires the efi bootloader file to be in the list of trusted bootloaders. If it isn't, grub fails to load. When installing, activate SB -> manually add EFI/grub/grub.efi to trusted list -> deactivate SB again. After this grub should be visible again.
