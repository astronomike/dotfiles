# Dotfiles

Storage for personal wm config files, plus backups of some other things like terminal and editor configs. Designed to be pretty minimal (but minimally pretty), mainly for coding work on my laptop. Low on system resources.

Uses a --bare git repo, following [this](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/) guide. 

Very much a work in progress, may or may not be updated.
