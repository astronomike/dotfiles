# Dotfiles

Storage area for personal wm config files. Designed to be pretty minimal (but minimally pretty), mainly for coding work on my old laptop. Low-ish on system resources and functional for my workflow.

Uses a --bare git repo, following [this](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/) guide. 

Very much a work in progress, may or may not be updated.

---
### Main software/packages needed 

- Qtile (and qtile-extras for widget decorations)
- Rofi
- Picom

See .config/archpkgs.txt for other useful stuff when setting up on an arch machine. 

--- 
#### Misc other things

Nerd fonts (something that provides `nerd-fonts`) is needed for glyphs in the bar.

Several other packages would be needed for notable functionality: 
  - touchpad gestures: `libinput-gestures`
  - power management: `xfce4-power-manager`
  - notifications: `xfce4-notifyd` 
  - coolness: `neofetch`
  
  ...

### Preview of current setup

Mostly based off of pastel/catpuccin colours, lots of r\unixporn inspiration.
