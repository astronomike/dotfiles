# Dotfiles

Storage for personal wm config files (mainly for my systems that use Qtile and picom), plus backups of some other configs like terminals and editors. 

Uses a --bare git repo, following [this](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/) guide.
